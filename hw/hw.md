## 1. CAD case design

Software: [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Download)

In order to design a case, one should get hold of one of the various
Raspberry Pi 3 CAD designs from the web. For example from:

* [GrabCAD (personal, noncommertial use only)](https://grabcad.com/)
* [Thingiverse (creative common licenses)](https://www.thingiverse.com/)

All the other designs can be found in the folder CAD.
A Raspberry Pi 3 design can also be created by oneself unsing the schematics
from [the Rasperry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/mechanical/README.md).
